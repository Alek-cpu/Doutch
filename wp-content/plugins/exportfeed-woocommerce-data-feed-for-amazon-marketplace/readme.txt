***“WooCommerce Data Feed for Amazon Marketplace** integrates perfectly with WooCommerce and easily creates feed meeting Amazon MWS specifications. It’s perfect for our antiques and collectibles website, which has over 3,000 products! The plugin is simple to install, error-free (i.e., no PHP errors), properly exports non-media feed variations with full support, provides excellent documentation & usability, and automatically updates feeds on your schedule. It is an excellent value, considering the developers offer free, live, online tech support even at very late hours. When they are not online, they usually respond within nominal time!  I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this plugin to anyone with WooCommerce!"*

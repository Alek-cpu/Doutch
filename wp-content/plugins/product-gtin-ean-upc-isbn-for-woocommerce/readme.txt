The **Product GTIN (EAN, UPC, ISBN) for WooCommerce** plugin adds the Global Trade Item Number (EAN, UPC, ISBN, JAN, ITF-14) field to WooCommerce products.

== Description ==

**Product GTIN (EAN, UPC, ISBN) for WooCommerce** lets you set the GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) for each product of your shop.
By default, WooCommerce allows to set the SKU custom field for a product, but sometimes the SKU isn't enough.
Google and Amazon use global trade item numbers (GTINs) to group identical products.
The most common GTINs are:

* UPC: this is the primary GTIN in North America.
* EAN/UCC: the major GTIN used outside of North America
* JAN: the Japanese GTIN
* ISBN: a GTIN for books

Another type of Identification Number is the MPN (Manufacturer Part Number). This code is required for all products that do not have an assigned GTIN.
These type of codes are important both for selling and for tracking your products.

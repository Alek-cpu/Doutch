Before work on features or bug fix you might want to open an issue first.

No need to do this for small things or evident bugs that need a fix.

After the change or new feature has been discussed, the contributing flow is:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature or bug-fix branch
3. Make your changes
4. Commit your changes
5. Run the tests, adding new ones for your own code if necessary.
6. Repeat 4, 5 and 6 until all tests pass.
6. Push to the branch
7. Create a pull request from your branch to "dev" branch
